@article{Niemela1996,
	Abstract = {Heterogeneity in species assemblages of forest-floor arthropods - carabid beetles, ants and spiders - within and between different forest age classes was studied in the southern Finnish taiga. The importance of processes operating on the local scale (within the movement radius of the species) vs on the regional scale (among forest stands) in determining the observed variation was assessed. Four data sets with different spatial resolutions in mesic forests in the same general study area were used. The material consists of 18 283 carabids of 51 species, 48 769 spiders of 212 species, and 126 718 worker ants of 23 species. Analyses of abundance variation and species complementarity among successional stages revealed that in all the three taxa species occurring in the mature forest were prevalent in the younger successional stages as well, constituting more than half of the catch in any age class. A great majority of carabid and spider species were widely distributed across the forest age-classes, whereas ants include a higher proportion of species with a narrower amplitude across the succession gradient. Comparisons of similarity between samples at increasing distance from one another on the local scale within forest stands (a few tens of meters to a few hundreds of meters) showed a quite consistent pattern in carabids and spiders: there was more variation between sampling sites in young successional forests than in the mature forest. Furthermore, only in the mature forest a slight, albeit statistically not significant, negative relationship between similarity of samples and distance between sampling sites was detected. In carabids and spiders, comparisons between samples located at a distance of 10-15 m from each other showed considerable heterogeneity, the mean percentage similarity being c. 0.6 (in ants c. 0.8). On the regional scale, systematic variation between young and mature forest stands is a major element increasing the total diversity (species turnover c. 50% in carabids and spiders; compositional similarity c. 0.3-0.4 in carabids, 0.2-0.3 in spiders), but variation within forest stands on a spatial scale of 10-15 meters is another important component in the total heterogeneity. The results suggest that regional abundance variation is a primary factor influencing the composition of local assemblages; a set of hypotheses elaborating this conclusion is formulated. The result implies that maintenance of habitat heterogeneity on a small scale (10-15 m) is needed to preserve biodiversity in managed forests.},

@article{Aizen1994,
	Abstract = {In a fragmented, dry subtropical forest in northwestern Argentina, we compared pollination levels, fruit set, and seed set among small (<1 ha) forest fragments, large (>2 ha) fragments, and continuous forest in 16 plant species representing a wide range of pollination systems, breeding systems, and growth forms. For three species, Prosopis nigra (Mimosoideae), Cercidium australe (Caesalpinoideae), and Atamisquea emarginata (Capparaceae), the three treatments were replicated across four sites; we achieved less replication for other species. Because comparisons between forest and fragment populations for different species took place in different sites, however, by treating all 6 species as a unit we lessened the potential bias of confounding site effects and could evaluate the overall impact of fragmentation. Significant or marginal (P < .10) fragmentation-related declines in number of pollen tubes per style, fruit set, and seed set occurred in 9 of 16, 5 of 15, and 3 of 14 species, respectively. Overall, significant or nonsignificant declines occurred in 81% (pollen tubes), 73% (fruit set), and 79% (seed set) of the species. In all cases these proportions were greater (P @< .06) than the null binomial expectation of a 1:1 ratio of increases to decreases. Breeding system did not explain sensitivity to fragmentation: the magnitudes of declines in pollen tubes, fruit set, and seed set were virtually indistinguishable between self-compatible and self-incompatible species. At least 4 of the 10 self-incompatible species, however, were heavily visited in small fragments by Africanized honey bees, which may have compensated for a decline in visits by native pollinators. The exact nature of responses varied among plant species. In some, the absolute quantity of pollen grains transferred to stigmas decreased with fragmentation, and sometimes this was reflected in reduced fruit or seed set. In Cercidium, Prosopis, and Atamisquea, the quality of the grains transferred apparently changed: number of pollen tubes produced per pollen grain on the stigma declined with increasing fragmentation, and at least in the latter two species seed production declined as well. Overall, levels of pollination and seed production undoubtedly integrated many idiosyncratic effects of fragmentation on particular plant and animal populations, and indicated that "community health" of fragments suffered in comparison with that of continuous forest. Median decreases in pollination levels and seed output from forest to fragments approached 20%. The impact of these declines on plant recruitment is less clear, however, because cattle grazing and trampling of seedlings and saplings in fragments may constitute a much more serious short-term conservation problem.},

@article{Smith1987,
	Abstract = {The ecology of seed predation was studied in mangrove forests. Controlled field experiments were used to assess the magnitude of predation on mangrove propagules, to test for differences in predation among five species of mangroves, and to examine how differential amounts of predation on seeds are correlated with conspecific dominance and may contribute to observed patterns of tree distribution across the intertidal region. Averaged over all species and forests, 75.7 @+ 28.7% (@? @+ 1 sd) of the seeds used in the experiments were consumed by predators (small crabs belonging to the family Grapsidae). Significant differences existed in the amounts of predation among mangrove species. Avicennia marina was most heavily preyed upon, followed in decreasing order by Bruguiera exaristata, Ceriops tagal, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, and Rhizophora stylosa. Differences in chemical composition of the propagules accounted fro @>97% of the differences in amounts of predation among the five species. Nutritive quality of the propagules, expressed as a function of protein, simple sugar, fiber, and tannin content, was more important in explaining the differences than was propagule size. Significant differences also existed among three forest types, which differed in species dominance. Lowest amounts of predation for C. tagal were in the forest where adults of this species were absent, and highest in the forest where the species was most dominant. For A. marina, the two Bruguieras, and R. stylosa, however, amounts of predation were significantly higher in forests where conspecifics were rare or absent and lowest where conspecifics were dominant. For these latter four species, conspecific dominance in the canopy explained @>63% of the variation in predation among forest types. The pattern of differences in seed predation among forests across the intertidal region indicates that seed predators may play a significant role in determining the intertidal distribution of the mangrove species studied.},

@article{Farrior2016,
	Abstract = {The distribution of tree size in tropical forests follows a power-law regardless of location. This pattern has largely eluded mechanistic explanation. Using 30 years of tree demography and growth data from a forest plot in Panama, Farrior et al. show that the power-law size structure emerges after natural local disturbances such as the gaps formed by falling trees. A model of forest dynamics identifies the structural parameter governing the power-law distribution. A mechanistic understanding of tropical forest structural dynamics will benefit forest carbon cycling studies.Science, this issue p. 155Tropical tree size distributions are remarkably consistent despite differences in the environments that support them. With data analysis and theory, we found a simple and biologically intuitive hypothesis to explain this property, which is the foundation of forest dynamics modeling and carbon storage estimates. After a disturbance, new individuals in the forest gap grow quickly in full sun until they begin to overtop one another. The two-dimensional space-filling of the growing crowns of the tallest individuals relegates a group of losing, slow-growing individuals to the understory. Those left in the understory follow a power-law size distribution, the scaling of which depends on only the crown area{\textendash}to{\textendash}diameter allometry exponent: a well-conserved value across tropical forests.},

@article{Prentice1992,
	Abstract = {A model to predict global patterns in vegetation physiognomy was developed from physiological considerations influencing the distributions of different functional types of plant. Primary driving variables are mean coldestmonth temperature, annual accumulated temeprature over $5^\circC$, and a drought index incorporating the seasonality of precipitation and the available water capacity of the soil. The model predicts which plant types can occur in a given environment, and selects the potentially dominant types from among them. Biomes arise as combinations of dominant types. Global environmental data were supplied as monthly means of temperature, precipitation and sunshine (interpolated to a global 0.5⚬ grid, with a lapse-rate correction) and soil texture class. The resulting predictions of global vegetation patterns were in good agreement with the mapped distribution of actual ecosystem complexes (Olson, J.S., Watts, J.A. & Allison, L.J. (1983) ORNL-5862, Oak Ridge Nat. Lab., 164 pp.), except where intensive agriculture has obliterated the natural patterns. The model will help in assessing impacts of future climate changes on potential natural vegetation patterns, land-surface characteristics and terrestrial carbon storage, and in analysis of the effects of past climate change on these variables.},

@article{Arii2002,
	Abstract = {We examine the influence of overstory trees and abiotic environmental factors on the patterns of spatial variation and species composition in the sapling community of an old-growth Fagus-Acer forest in southwestern Qu{\'e}bec, Canada. Our main focus was to identify differences in the sapling distribution patterns of Fagus grandifolia and Acer saccharum, the two codominant species in the overstory, as well as the factors that determine the differences. Using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), we show that soil moisture has the strongest influence on the spatial variation and species composition of the sapling community. Acer saccharum occurred on a wide range of soil moisture conditions, while Fagus grandifolia saplings were absent in dry habitats. Another factor that differentiates the distribution patterns of Fagus grandifolia and Acer saccharum saplings is the relative dominance of Fagus grandifolia trees in the overstory, which correlates negatively with pH and Ca availability in the forest floor. Acer saccharum saplings were not found on sites where Fagus grandifolia trees dominate the overstory, while Fagus grandifolia saplings are mostly limited to sites where Fagus grandifolia trees have high representation in the overstory. These findings are discussed in light of previous hypotheses on canopy tree replacement patterns in Fagus-Acer forests. Dans cet article, nous examinons l'influence des arbres formant la strate sup{\'e}rieure d'une for{\^e}t et celle des facteurs physiques sur les patrons de variation spatiale et la composition en esp{\`e}ces d'une communaut{\'e} de gaules. L'{\'e}tude s'est d{\'e}roul{\'e}e dans une for{\^e}t ancienne de h{\^e}tres et d'{\'e}rables du sud-ouest du Qu{\'e}bec, au Canada. Nous avons surtout cherch{\'e} {\`a} identifier les diff{\'e}rences dans les patrons de r{\'e}partition des gaules de Fagus grandifolia et Acer saccharum, les deux esp{\`e}ces dominantes de la strate sup{\'e}rieure, de m{\^e}me que les facteurs qui en sont responsables. Selon une analyse des correspondances canoniques, l'humidit{\'e} du sol est la caract{\'e}ristique du milieu qui influence le plus la r{\'e}partition spatiale et la composition en esp{\`e}ces de la communaut{\'e} de gaules. Les jeunes {\'E}rables {\`a} sucre s'accommodent d'un large spectre de conditions d'humidit{\'e} du sol. Par contre, aucun gaule d'H{\^e}tre {\`a} grandes feuilles n'a {\'e}t{\'e} trouv{\'e} dans les habitats secs. Un autre facteur qui diff{\'e}rencie les patrons de r{\'e}partition des gaules des deux esp{\`e}ces est la dominance du h{\^e}tre dans la strate sup{\'e}rieure. Cette dominance est corr{\'e}l{\'e}e de fa{\c c}on n{\'e}gative avec le pH et la disponibilit{\'e} du calcium dans le sol. En effet, les jeunes {\'e}rables ne poussent pas l{\`a} o{\`u} les h{\^e}tres dominent la strate sup{\'e}rieure, alors que les jeunes h{\^e}tres ne croissent qu'aux endroits o{\`u} les h{\^e}tres adultes composent l'essentiel de la vo{\^u}te foresti{\`e}re. Ces r{\'e}sultats sont analys{\'e}s en tenant compte des hypoth{\`e}ses en vigueur sur les patrons de remplacement des arbres composant la vo{\^u}te foresti{\`e}re dans les for{\^e}ts d'{\'e}rables et de h{\^e}tres.},
