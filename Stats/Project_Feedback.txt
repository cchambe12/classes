<><><  Lydia  <><><
<><><><><><><><><><
Lydia is investigating the outcome of Ebola positive patients. Patient outcome is based on survival. Her predictor variables are date (which falls in three ranges), gender, age, quantity of ebola in the blood stream, presence of plasmodium (the malaria causing parasite), and presence of GB Virus C (which has demonstrated greater success for HIV positive patients). Past research has show that plasmodium and GB Virus C have an additive effect in survival against Ebola. For this reason, Lydia wishes to focus primarily on the effects of the parasite and virus presence. However, due to the intensity of the outbreak, Lydia is missing large chunks of the data, especially later in the dataset. The class suggested Lydia focus on one time point where most of the data is (the first date range) or to focus on certain age groups. Due to the power of Bayesian, I suggest Lydia uses all of her available data and inputs the data into a logistic regression model framework since it is a survival model and in binary scale. Since the presence of plasmodium and GB Virus C are additive, I suggest she keeps those as main effects, but I suggest interacting each with age since it is likely there will be collinearity with age and presence of each. Or maybe she should center the presence predictors.

<><>< Jenny <><><
<><><><><><><><><
Jenny is doing an experiment on evolution of E. Coli fitness. She is testing the fitness of E. Coli on three different treatments: presence of E. Coli C, presence of K12, and a treatment that alters between the two each day. She has five replicates for each treatments across three time points. For this project, however, she will focus on only one time point. There are three assay hosts, C, K12, and B. B is the ancestral host. Jenny’s question is if the E. Coli strains will lose fitness when they are moved to a new host or will they be able to adapt. Her response variable is fitness and her predictors are evolutionary history, assay host, and the interaction between the two with a random variable by line (or replicate). The main concern of the class was having enough robust data. Most of her data is grouped by 3s or 5s, rather than the desired 6-12. We agreed with her model, however, I am unsure why an interaction is necessary for evolutionary history and assay host? I also suggest Jenny builds the model up and starts simply. What does she think is the most powerful predictor? Start there until she can add the random effect of line. I think if she builds her model as such, she could think about adding an additional level of hierarchy that includes the three time points. If she repeats the experiment in the future, maybe she should consider using 6 lines per treatment and repeat the experiment 6 times. However, I think having 6 populations per treatment is more important that whole experiment replication.

<><>< Meghan <><><
<><><><><><><><><>
Meghan’s experiment is looking at a common garden in Oregon. She is focused on 16 different provenance locations for Poplar trees across the Pacific Northwest. For each population, she has 3 different genotypes with 3 replicates of each. Her response variable is the carbon storage of the tree. Her main effect is phenology because she believes that will be the strongest driver in the variance of carbon stores. The class suggested she will need to correct for spatial distance by choosing a mid point and then evaluating the distance of the provenance location to that mid point. The class also suggested she builds two separate models to start: one that uses genotype as the random effect and one that uses population as the random effect. I suggest she integrates a new predictor variable that also acts as a spatial correction and includes distance of the provenance location from the centroid of the range distribution. This may show another relationship to fitness — individuals closer the range edge may have lower carbon stores than those near the interior of the range. For the larger, final model, I believe she should introduce that additional level of hierarchy as well that has a variable that varies by genotype by population. Also, I think it is very important to start with a very simple model that just looks at one main effect first. She may decide to add interactions later, which I think she should investigate before deciding not to include them, especially if she chooses to use both the location within the range and phenological variation.
